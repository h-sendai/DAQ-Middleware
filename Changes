Summary

- All users have to recompile their components to have get_run_number() work
  properly.
- Libraries (Sock, Json) have not been changed.
- We have dispatcher in the example directory.
- We have documentation in the documentation directory (/usr/share/daqmw/docs).

Details

BUF FIX: DaqOperator coredumped if the component is SkeletonComp only.
FEATURE: Add dispatcher component in the example directory
         (/usr/share/daqmw/examples).
FEATURE: Add documentation (DAQ-Middleware Technical Manual and Developer's
         Manual).
