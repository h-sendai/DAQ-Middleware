Summary

- All users have to recompile their components to have get_run_number() work
  properly.
- Libraries (Sock, Json) have not been changed.
- We have dispatcher in the example directory.
- We have documentation in the documentation directory (/usr/share/daqmw/docs).

Details

BUG FIX: get_run_number() did not return the run number but always returned 0.
BUF FIX: DaqOperator coredumped if the component is SkeletonComp only.
FEATURE: Add dispatcher component in the example directory
         (/usr/share/daqmw/examples).
FEATURE: Add documentation (DAQ-Middleware Technical Manual and Developer's
         Manual).
CLEANUP: Remove ConfFileParser::setList(std::vector & list, char*, char*)
         from ConfFileParser.cpp because no one does not use this method.
CLEANUP: Remove src/DaqOperator/ServerSocket.{h,cpp}.  No one does not use
         this.
CLEANUP: add #include <stdio.h> in src/lib/SiTCP/CPP/Sock/Sock.h and
         src/DaqOperator/CreateDom.h to be able to compile with gcc44.
CLEANUP: Move set_status() from private to protected in
         src/DaqComponent/DaqComponentBase.h (pointed out by Hosoya san).
